# Getting Started in Machine Learning

PMLG is open and very keen to see new members both join our group and get started with machine learning. This repository will start to collect some resources that may make this process easier.

We are always looking to improve, so if you feel there is missing information, guides or anything else that will help someone to get started, please [Open an Issue](https://github.com/pmlg/Getting-started-in-ML/issues) or create a PR with your additions.

## Jargon/Glossary
The language used when talking about machine learning can be intimidating and limit beginners involvement in discussion. There is a great resource [Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) that provides a lot of short descriptions of these terms.

## Learning to Code

Being able to at least read code and venture into writing it yourself can be a barrier when you've come to learn machine learning. Good code can become easy to read without needing to write your own, but plenty of it out therer isn't very beginner friendly. For our group, Python is the predominate language of choice and you'll find below a few resources to get started on learning it.

* [DatatCamp - Intro to Python for Data Science](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) *(web)*
* [Learn to Code with Python](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/learn-to-code-with-python/id953972812) *(iOS)*

## Running code
Machine learning requires running code (in our case typically Python code) and this can be a barrier for anyone with a desire to do machine learning but hits limitations with reading, writing and running the code. 

Check out the [Environments](environments) page to see some places where you can learn and run code for free.
