# Getting Started in Machine Learning

PMLG is open and very keen to see new members both join our group and get started with machine learning. This repository will start to collect some resources that may make this process easier.

We are always looking to improve, so if you feel there is missing information, guides or anything else that will help someone to get started, please [Open an Issue](https://github.com/pmlg/Getting-started-in-ML/issues) or create a PR with your additions.

## Running code
Machine learning requires running code (in our case typically Python code) and this can be a barrier for anyone with a desire to do machine learning but hits limitations with reading, writing and running the code. 

Check out the [Environments](environments) page to see some places where you can learn and run code for free.

## Jargon/Glossary
The language used when talking about machine learning can be intimidating and limit beginners involvement in discussion. There is a great resource [Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/) that provides a lot of short descriptions of these terms.
